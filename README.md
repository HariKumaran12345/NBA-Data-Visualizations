## Shot Map Instructions

shotMap.py takes the following command line format to run properly: python shotMap.py (First Name Last Name of Player) (Season in the form (YYYY-YY)), f
for example you can run the file to find Lebron James's shotmap this past season by running **python shotMap.py Lebron James 2023-24**
The resulting output will show you the overarching makes and misses plotted with green circles and red X's respectively.

shotMapByTeam is similar except instead of the player name you can put a team name and it will show the shot maps for players who have played a certain number of games
and a certain number of points. An example command line instruction is **python shotMapByTeam Los Angeles Lakers 2023-24**
